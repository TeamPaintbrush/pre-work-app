# GitHub Pages Deployment Instructions

## What I Fixed

1. **Updated GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml`):
   - Updated to use the latest GitHub Pages deployment actions
   - Added proper permissions for Pages deployment
   - Split build and deploy into separate jobs
   - Added workflow_dispatch for manual triggering

2. **Added Root Redirect** (`index.html`):
   - Created a fallback redirect page at the repository root
   - Automatically redirects to the React app at `/pre-work-app/`
   - Provides visual feedback during redirect

3. **Added CNAME File** (`public/CNAME`):
   - Ensures proper domain configuration
   - Gets copied to `out/CNAME` during build

## Current Status

âœ… **Build**: Successfully compiles  
âœ… **Static Export**: Generated in `/out` directory  
âœ… **GitHub Actions**: Updated workflow pushed  
âœ… **Domain Setup**: CNAME file configured  

## What You Need to Do

### 1. Check GitHub Pages Settings
Go to: `https://github.com/TeamPaintbrush/pre-work-app/settings/pages`

**Ensure these settings:**
- **Source**: "GitHub Actions" (not "Deploy from a branch")
- **Custom domain**: Leave blank for now

### 2. Monitor Deployment
- Go to: `https://github.com/TeamPaintbrush/pre-work-app/actions`
- Watch for the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow to complete
- Should see âœ… green checkmark when done

### 3. Access Your Site
After deployment completes:
- **Main URL**: `https://teampaintbrush.github.io/pre-work-app/`
- **Fallback**: `https://teampaintbrush.github.io/pre-work-app.git/` (redirects to main)

## Expected Results

ðŸŽ¯ **The React app should now load correctly instead of the README**

### If It Still Shows README:
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5)
2. Wait 5-10 minutes for GitHub Pages cache to update
3. Check GitHub Actions for any deployment errors
4. Verify Pages settings are using "GitHub Actions" source

## Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
```bash
# Manually trigger deployment
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger deployment"
git push origin main
```

### If Pages shows 404:
- Check that `out/index.html` exists after build
- Verify basePath is `/pre-work-app` in next.config.js
- Ensure GitHub Pages source is set to "GitHub Actions"

## Features Available

Your deployed app includes:
- âœ… Interactive checklist management
- âœ… Progress tracking with analytics
- âœ… Media capture and photo management  
- âœ… Export functionality (JSON/PDF)

**The deployment should now work correctly! ðŸš€**
